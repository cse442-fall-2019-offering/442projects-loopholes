## Does your team need a web server to host your project?
Yes

## Does your team need a database server to be used by your project?
Perhaps (we were thinking of using Firebase)

## Alternate dispute resolution approach
When we cannot agree, our team’s alternate dispute resolution approach is to have a foam rocket war. Last person standing will win the right to pursue their idea. The rest of the team will acquiesce and acknowledge the victor’s skill in foam rocket combat.

## Description of the completed version of the project.
Leaflets and posters are scattered all over campus-- from tables, to walls, to lecture halls. Unfortunately, they often go unnoticed and become little more than unnecessary litter. Our project aims to have all posters and announcements in one place: UBulletin. UBulletin will be an online bulletin board that allows posters and announcements to reach more than just the floors of UB. Viewing the website will be open to the public. To post, users will need to verify that they attend UB by entering their email. Once the project is complete, a typical user should be able to upload an image of their poster or announcement to UBulletin. If the user has not yet created a poster or announcement for what they want to advertise, UBulletin will offer templates to help get them started. All uploaded images will be available to view on the site. However, a filtering system and human moderators will prevent harmful or disrespectful images from being uploaded to UBulletin. Users will be able to vote on posters, boosting the activity advertised to the top of the search results. A search bar and tagging system will be available for users who want to explore beyond initial results.

## Description of a typical user of the project and how they would use it.
Our project’s typical user is a UB college student. The student may want to get involved in campus extracurriculars, or is already involved. 

**First Scenario: Student is involved**

This user has an event or organization they want to advertise on campus. The student would use UBulletin to upload an announcement or poster for their event or organization, advertising to the other users of UBulletin. If they know what they want to advertise, but don’t have a poster, the student can use one of UBulletin’s templates to create one. The student can add tags to their creation so it may be easily found by other users. The student may also vote for the posters of the organizations or events they are involved in.

**Second Scenario: Student is not involved**

This user wants to find a campus event or organization that piques their interest. The student would visit UBulletin to see all of the posters or announcements uploaded for the events and organizations on campus. If what they seek is not in the immediate top results (most popular, most recent), the student can utilize UBulletin’s search function and tagging system for more tailored results. If they support an event or organization, the student may vote for that event or organization’s poster.
